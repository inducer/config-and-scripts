in terms of math, and in terms of programming? Are you more interested
in high performance, or in numerics? Do you have any code on Github that
I could look at?

Something that would certainly get my attention would be to send a pull
request (on Github) that solves an outstanding issue in one of the
pieces of software I maintain:

recordings will be available. That said, I cannot promise you that you
can be successful in 450 while missing parts of the lecture--the class
is not designed that way. Please state in your reply that you are
assuming all risk for poor outcomes that may be the result of this.  You
will be held to the same standard as anyone else in the class, with no
expectation of lenience with grading or assignments or anything else.

In addition, 450 will offer frequent ungraded in-class activities which
I highly recommend you work through as you watch the lecture recordings.

If you would still like to proceed, please let me know how I would go
about entering that override.

cannot. The problem is that if I were to offer you extra 'private office
hours', I would have to offer everyone else in the class (a few hundred
of them!) the same to convincingly say that I am not treating you
preferentially (which I am not allowed to do).

have not gotten better.)

(2) Present me with a dated note from a health care provider (McKinley

Thank you for your message! I am almost always looking for promising PhD
students, and this year is no exception. I have funding available for a variety
of projects.

For now, the most important thing is for you to get your application submitted.
Here's the starting point for that:

http://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate

When you submit your application, please make sure to specify 'Scientific
Computing' as one of your fields of interest, and that you mention my name as a
possible research advisor. This ensures that your application gets handled
efficiently.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Andreas" nil 1)

    ("ms2phd" "Thank you for your interest in working with me. It sounds like you have experience that has relevance to the type of research I do. From your message, it sounds like you would be wanting to pursue a PhD in CS in the area of Scientific Computing, correct? If so, the best first step to take is to fire off an application to the CS PhD program. I've heard that this is still a substantial hurdle even if you are applying from on-campus, but I don't know the exact specifics. The academic office can help you there--they're in 1210 Siebel. I unfortunately can't help you in gaining admission to the program--who gets in is solely the admission committee's decision.

All the best with your application, and thank you for your understanding.

do my job, please provide me with the following pieces of information:

- What precisely are you applying for?

- When is the letter due?
  (Note that this if this less than THREE WEEKS from now, I am
  unlikely to be able to complete your letter on time.)

- How will I be submitting the letter? Email/web/regular mail?
  Please provide detailed instructions, and if I need to watch for an
  email notification, please ping me when it is supposed to arrive.
  
- Is there anything specific (qualities/experiences/knowledge) that
  you'd like me to highlight that would enhance the narrative of your
  application?
  
In addition to the above, please provide me with:

- Your curriculum vitae

- Your statement of purpose for this application

- An unofficial transcript or grade overview

I would also appreciate it if you could send me a brief reminder a few
days before the letter is due. I will send you an email confirming
that I've submitted my letter once I've done so.

All the best with your application!

    ("classreg" "Thank you you for your interest in CS450. Registration is closed for the course because it has reached its room capacity. My recommendation would be to go talk to the academic office in 1210 Siebel Center. They will be able to help you more directly than I can. In addition, I'd recommend that you continue to watch for slots as we're headed towards the beginning of the semester. Definitely try showing up for the class and see if there are seats available. A large class such as this hardly ever runs at full capacity all the way to the end of the term, so you will likely have a good chance at securing a spot, given enough time. If the course is a requirement for you, please let the academic office know so that they can accommodate you. This page has more info on CS course restrictions:

You are welcome to take part in course activities such as homework and quizzes as the class begins. These activities will count towards your grade if you end up securing a spot, and if you have kept up with course work, I would be happy to discuss letting you into the class even after the add deadline.

You can find all related receipts in this folder:

I have physical receipts for gas, hotel, and rental car that duplicate those
in the folder.  I'll bring those by on Wednesday morning. Breakfast was
included at the hotel, lunch was covered at the conference, and there
was a conference dinner Friday night. If possible, I would like to
request a per-diem reimbursement for the remaining meals from Thursday
dinner through Sunday.

Please fund this out of my ICR startup account.
